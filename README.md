# Background Generator

This is a simple background generator that allows you to create gradient backgrounds using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can select two colors and instantly see how a gradient background is generated in real-time.

## How It Works

The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the basic page structure with two color selectors and an area where the CSS gradient background is displayed.

The CSS file (`style.css`) contains basic styles and defines the page's appearance.

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) handles the logic for creating the gradient background in response to changes in the color selectors.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

2. Select the two colors you want for the gradient background using the color selectors.

3. The gradient background will be automatically generated and displayed in the designated area.

4. Copy the generated CSS code below to use it in your project.
